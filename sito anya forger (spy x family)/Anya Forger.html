            <p id="Intro">
                Anya Forger (アーニャ・フォージャー, Ānya Fōjā) is the deuteragonist of the SPY x FAMILY series. She is the adopted daughter of 
                <a href="Loid Forger.html">Loid</a>
                and 
                <a href="Yor Forger.html">Yor</a> 
                Forger. 
                She attends Eden Academy as a first-year student in Cecile Hall, Class 3.
                Anya, formerly known as Test Subject "007" (被験体"007", Hikentai "007"), is also a telepath whose abilities were created in an experiment conducted by an unknown organization.

                        Anya is a short young girl with emerald green eyes.
                        At the time of their first meeting, 
                        <a href="Loid Forger.html">Loid</a> 
                        describes her as appearing about four to five years old Anya's eyes are large and oval-shaped, with prominent eyelashes.
                        She has shoulder-length, light pink hair that curls inwards with a fringe that reaches just above her eyes and a small strand of ahoge at the top of her head.
                        Anya is noticeably shorter than most of her peers, and many of the insults that 
                        <a href="Damian Desmond.html">Damian</a> 
                        and his friends direct at her target her small size. 
                        However, in 
                        <a href="Damian Desmond.html">Damian's</a>

                        When 
                        <a href="Loid Forger.html">Loid</a> 
                        met Anya for the first time in the orphanage, she wore a simple black dress with a white ribbon at the front, along with white folded-down socks and black shoes.
                        She usually wears this outfit when at home.
                        Anya also wears two small horns on the sides of her head. Anya is rarely seen without her hair ornaments.
                        The only other times where she is shown to not be wearing them were in her past and at the end-of-class gala, in which her hair is tied into small buns in place of the ornaments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At Eden Academy, Anya wears the standard uniform with white knee-high socks and black Mary Janes.
                        She carries around a brown schoolbag with a sheep keychain attached.
                        During physical education class, Anya ties her hair back with a red headband when wearing the school gym uniform, along with white socks and gym shoes. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When she was younger, her hair was slightly shorter and wore clothing that resembled scrubs.

                        However, her abilities have their limits. Anya finds it difficult to understand complicated minds, such as

                        When she reads the minds of people with excessively strong emotions, like

                        and Fiona, it causes a reaction similar to a heartburn. 
                        She must also be within a certain distance of her target to read minds.

                            Anya's involuntary use of her telepathic abilities made her a bit more aware of her surroundings.

                            It even helps her pick up on the enemies of her parents being nearby.

            <div class="d-flex flex-column flex-md-row" >
                <p> 
                 <b>General Skill</b>: Anya is shown to be poor in a variety of skills, including studying, drawing, sports, and music. She often obtains single-digit scores for her tests and resorts to her telepathic abilities to get through classes and exams instead, refusing to study unless under Loid's strict supervision and during her "Eclipsing." Even when motivated to study during her midterm exams, she just barely passes. She tries to play a child-sized violin Loid buys her but causes the strings to snap with her bad playing.

                    <b>Eclipsing</b>: In a phenomenon dubbed "Eclipsing" by the scientists at Anya's former laboratory, Anya's telepathic abilities are temporarily disabled during the new moon.

                <p class="poor">
                    <b>Poor Grammatic</b>: Anya has very poor grammatic skills. It is often that whenever she shows her personal notes to anyone, they cannot understand what   she is writing, comparing it with a bunch of scrawls.
                </p>
                <p class="poor">
                    <b>Poor Academics</b>: Anya has low to sub-par abilities when it comes to academics, notably scoring very low in most of the tests she has taken at Eden Academy. She seems to have an over-reliance on her telepathy skills, especially when troubled, primarily using it to answer homework questions and sometimes cheat on tests. Her poor academics can be partially attributed to the advanced material she is studying, paired with her being younger than she claims to be.

                <p class="crak">
                    <b>Crowds</b>: When Anya is exposed to huge crowds, she often tends to get dizzy or exhausted by uncontrollably reading most of the whole crowd's minds, resulting in her suffering from nosebleeds. This is especially emphasized when the crowd has aggressive or generally fearful thoughts, as these are apparently the first thoughts that alert Anya's powers.

                    <b>Lack of Athletic Ability</b>: Befitting her age, Anya is extremely poor when it comes to physical exercises, getting winded easily, having poor coordination and low strength, being unable to throw a ball properly despite Yor's training, and her putting her full strength into it. This lack of ability has extended to various sports, including tennis, jump rope, swimming, and vaulting. Over time, her athletic ability has slightly improved, as Loid has reported to Sylvia that she can now jump over two vaulting boxes and jump rope five times in a row. Her throwing ability appears to have also improved, as she was able to throw Yor's stiletto from one floor to another.
