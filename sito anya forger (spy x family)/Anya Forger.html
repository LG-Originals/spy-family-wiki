                                Anya is noticeably shorter than most of her peers, and many of the insults that

                                She usually wears this outfit when at home.
                                Anya also wears two small horns on the sides of her head. Anya is rarely seen without her hair ornaments.
                                The only other times where she is shown to not be wearing them were in her past and at the end-of-class gala, in which her hair is tied into small buns in place of the ornaments.

                                and Fiona, it causes a reaction similar to a heartburn. 
                                She must also be within a certain distance of her target to read minds.
                                Anya's involuntary use of her telepathic abilities made her a bit more aware of her surroundings. 
                                It enables her to see through

                                disguises, hear somebody being in danger, and notice Yor sneaking into her school to give her the P.E. uniform.
                                It even helps her pick up on the enemies of her parents being nearby.
