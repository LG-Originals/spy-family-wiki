                    Loid Forger (ロイド・フォージャー, Roido Fōjā) is the main protagonist of the SPY x FAMILY series. His true name is currently unknown, as he has discarded everything about his past to work for his home country, Westalis, as an undercover spy who acts under the codename "Twilight". 
                    For his current mission, in which he must marry and have a child, Twilight moves to Ostania, creates the alias "Loid Forger," and starts the Forger Family, becoming the adoptive father of

                            Loid is a very handsome man with short blond ruffled hair, blue eyes, and light skin. His hair is often slicked back to varying degrees, depending on the occasion, and his eyes are usually narrowed, slanted, and sharp. Loid is quite tall, with a slim but athletic build. His exact age is unknown, although his history and appearance point to him being in his late twenties or early thirties. Because of his handsome looks, many girls become infatuated with Loid; even

                    <p>
                        When Loid is outside, he often wears a light green three-piece suit with a red tie, a long-sleeved white shirt, and black leather shoes. On the suit's left lapel, he wears a pin shaped like a dagger with the symbol of WISE at its center. Occasionally, Loid also wears hats of different colors (for example, black, brown, or white) and shapes, a long tan trench coat, black gloves, or a black watch on his left wrist.

                    <p>
                        In some of his spy missions involving either infiltration or combat, Loid wears a black outfit. It consists of a long-sleeved shirt, pants tucked into boots, a belt, a beanie-like hat equipped with goggles, fingerless gloves, and a mask that covers the lower portion of his face. He also retains his signature WISE pin on the left side of his chest.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Loid's home attire typically consists of plain T-shirts (white, gray, or black) with long black pants or blue jeans. Periodically, he can be seen wearing a vest or long-sleeved sweater. When working his psychiatrist job in Berlint General Hospital, Loid wears a lab coat over his shirt and tie.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a child, Loid wore a white long-sleeved button-down shirt, black shorts with suspenders, white crew socks, and black shoes. When joining the second East-West war, he wore the standard soldier uniform of Westalian Army.

                        Befitting of a spy, Twilight is able to project whatever personality is necessary for his mission, though his true personality is rather cold, practical, and methodical, doing whatever it takes to complete the mission, from joining terrorist organizations to dating a target's daughter to becoming a father. His title as Westalis's greatest spy is quite deserved, as his skills, both physical and mental, are second to none. He is able to effortlessly disarm an army of well-trained spies, remaining ice-cold under pressure, and calmly analyze any given situation and create a plan in seconds. Loid can not only figure out an entire person's personality and develop a tailored list of answers to any question they could ask, but he can keep track of that list in his mind, as well as an extensive number of codes.

                        Loid is normally seen to be a calm, aloof, and calculating individual who takes every situation seriously and merely views his approaches as logical means to an end. Contrary to his apathetic front, Loid has a kind and caring personality that reveals itself when it comes to his new family, even at the risk of his mission. Though highly focused and prioritized on his work, Loid has occasionally shown that he's capable of respecting individuals, as seen when he spoke for 
                        <a href="Damian Desmond.html">Damian Desmond</a> 
                        in the meeting with his father, Donovan Desmond, his main target in Operation Strix, despite not being the initial intent of his encounter. Despite his stoicism and outwardly stern appearance, Loid has shown to bear a hidden selfless, solicitous, and concerned nature.

                    <p>
                        One of Loid's goals as a spy is to work hard to understand the people around him, whether they are his targets or his fake family, trying to figure out what makes them tick and who they really are. However, Loid admits that he does not understand women or children. This has led to a lot of frustration when dealing with his family, as their unpredictable actions often make him overthink his interactions with them. To cope, he tries to plan for every possible scenario, but since he can rarely predict 
                        <a href="Yor Forger.html">Yor</a> 
                        or

                        , he often fails. Because of this, he often misunderstands their intentions; even though their reasons are often very simple, the misunderstandings mainly root from them keeping their own secrets from Loid.

                        For instance, he once asked 
                        <a href="Yor Forger.html">Yor</a> 
                        on a date because he thought he had upset her, and came up with 862 plans to get her to enjoy herself on the outing. However, nearly all of his plans were scuttled from the onset due to the fact that 
                        <a href="Yor Forger.html">Yor</a> 
                        was, in fact, not upset but was in pain due to having been shot in the rear the previous night. As it involved her secret assassin work, Loid misinterpreted her attempt to mask her pain as being unhappy with him. Since she could not sit down on the day of the date but refused to explain why, it was nearly a disaster in spite of all his plans. It has also caused him to be entirely oblivious to Fiona Frost's obsessive infatuation with him, and to the fact that 
                        <a href="Anya Forger.html">Anya's</a>
                        friend, Becky, has a crush on him.

                    Loid usually pursues his missions with an incessant and unwavering determination, often willing go to any lengths to accomplish his objectives, regardless of what the costs are. Despite his willingness, he has a strong sense of responsibility in that it is his burden and his alone to make his mission successful. He only kills when absolutely necessary and sees putting innocent civilians, even his pawns, in danger as unacceptable. For example, after he rescued 
                    <a href="Anya Forger.html">Anya</a> 
                    from Edgar, he intended to move her to a better orphanage and make a new plan for Operation Strix without involving a child. Additionally, while he knows he will ultimately leave 
                    <a href="Anya Forger.html">Anya</a> 
                    and 
                    <a href="Yor Forger.html">Yor</a> 
                    at the end of Operation Strix, he intends to make sure they are well provided for and kept safe upon the mission's completion.

                        Even the lives of animals are factored into his calculations. During the plot to assassinate Minister Brantz, Loid was at one point being pursued by a trained dog with a bomb strapped to his back. At the conclusion of the chase, he had the opportunity to shoot it at nearly point-blank range after it leaped at him. Instead of doing so, he shot the straps of the bomb backpack, allowed the dog to bite him, then grabbed the bomb off the dog and threw it into a nearby river. He then confined and later rescued the dog, who was adopted by

                        Despite being a brilliant and capable spy, Loid can be overwhelmed and unwillingly forced to his limits. For example, when he celebrated 
                        <a href="Anya Forger.html">Anya</a> 
                        passing the first part of Eden Academy's entrance exam, he succumbed to all fatigue and exhaustion (something Loid did not think possible) and believed he had lost his edge. Loid also can feel overly stressed when dealing with difficult tasks, especially when things do not go as planned or go wrong. To achieve his goal of getting close to Donovan Desmond, when Loid saw that making 
                        <a href="Anya Forger.html">Anya</a> 
                        into an Imperial Scholar would be too difficult, he came up with an alternative plan where 
                        <a href="Anya Forger.html">Anya</a> 
                        would befriend Donovan's second son, 
                        <a href="Damian Desmond.html">Damian</a>
                        , in the hopes that she would be invited to his home to play, which would allow Loid a chance to make contact with Donovan. However, he was completely dejected upon learning that 
                        <a href="Anya Forger.html">Anya</a> 
                        hit 
                        <a href="Damian Desmond.html">Damian</a> 
                        and earned a Tonitrus Bolt on her first day of school; believing that the boy would most likely hate

                        now, both of Loid's plans were wrecked and left him unable to hide his anxiety.

                        Possibly resulting from his upbringing, Loid holds a rather strict discipline. It is his belief that practice and understanding are essential when it comes to studying, so when he tutors 
                        <a href="Anya Forger.html">Anya</a>
                        , he often tries to drill the information into her without her consideration and scold her for spelling mistakes. When he first started tutoring her, Loid wanted to ensure that 
                        <a href="Anya Forger.html">Anya</a> 
                        fully understood the material she was working on, to the point of not giving breaks and banning her from watching cartoons until she got it. This, of course, upset 
                        <a href="Anya Forger.html">Anya</a> 
                        and led to squabbles between the two. However, thanks to 
                        <a href="Yor Forger.html">Yor's</a> 
                        suggestion, Loid has started becoming more lenient with her but still remains firm. Loid's strict behavior was also seen during his initial dog-guard training with Bond, where he quickly scolded the dog for mistakes and scared him a bit. However, Loid realized he was being too harsh and changed his approach to be gentler while making up with them.

                        Loid is one of the many victims of the second East-West war, having lost everything in the brutal bloodshed and was left to fend for himself in war-torn streets. To keep his emotions in check, he found it necessary to "turn off" his feelings and refuse to let himself have feelings of love or hate. This is crucial to his success as a spy; a spy with too much emotional attachment will hesitate to commit necessary despicable acts while one that fosters hate will create unnecessary violence. As a result, Loid has become very withdrawn and reclusive. Despite his expertise in social situations, he could not understand the appeal of certain past-time activities, such as watching fireworks, and would frequently come off as morose.

                        After years of isolation and seclusion, Loid has become detached from the very notion of developing any meaningful connections. Somewhat of a loner with the belief that people like him are not allowed to have any form of attachment either due to his true identity or actions, he often distances himself from essentially everyone, only closely interacting with certain individuals for extended periods of time if his assignment requires it. In spite of the Forgers only being intended to be a family for appearances, spending time with this family has allowed Loid to gradually begin letting his guard down and create trusting relationships with them. He sympathized with 
                        <a href="Anya Forger.html">Anya</a> 
                        and her desire to have a family. He has also opened up to

                        about his past, something he rarely brings up, to help affirm her place with the family. Bond is an equally important member of the Forger family to Loid and is the only member Loid has openly discussed his spy activities with, even once letting the dog tag along in a mission.

                        Loid's past as a powerless war orphan, where he experienced despair and isolation, has seemingly stuck with him into his adult years and serves as his detestation for warfare and motivation as a spy to create a world without war, where children would not have to cry and share his experiences. As someone who threw away his entire identity and previous life to become a spy, he sincerely empathizes with people like 
                        <a href="Yor Forger.html">Yor</a>
                        , who sacrifices oneself for the sake of others and their beliefs, which was the deciding factor for her decision to marry him. In addition, Loid values friendship, emphasizing to

                        Unlike his current personality, Loid was once more emotional and naive. As a child, he was honest, rarely lied to his parents, and was easily influenced by public opinion without considering the bigger picture. Not understanding what war really meant, Loid enjoyed playing war games and was excited about the idea of being a soldier to fight the "evil" Ostanians, believing the propaganda he heard on the radio. Despite this, he was a good kid at heart who did not actually like violence but simply did not grasp the reality of war. When he lied to his father to receive pocket money to buy a soldier set, he quickly felt guilty about it, almost confessing to his father immediately afterward and wishing to work for money to pay his father back. After his father disappeared during the Ostania's initial raid of Westalis, Loid felt even more guilty and vowed to tell his father the truth when he returned; unfortunately, his father never did and most likely perished in the war along with his mother.

                        Perhaps his most ardent conviction is his belief that ignorance is both an intolerable weakness and an inexcusable moral shortcoming. This stems from the fact that up until his recruitment by WISE, practically everything he had believed in was based on incomplete information. Loid managed to survive and became an impassioned, well-meaning, but foolish soldier who blindly believed that the Ostanians were simply war-mongering monsters who had gleefully started this war to destroy Westalis. He hated the Ostanians for seemingly starting the war that took his parents and childhood friends, and he would go on to kill many Ostanian soldiers in vengeance. However, a chance encounter with 
                        <a href="Frankie Franklin.html">Franky</a> 
                        (who was then an Ostanian deserter) exposed him to the possibility that Ostania may not have started the war, but that instead, Westalis may have launched a false flag operation as an instigating excuse. A short while later, he also discovered that his childhood friends had all survived the initial bombing of his hometown, reuniting with them.

                        These two encounters, combined with the deaths of all his friends shortly thereafter, made Loid realize that his ignorance had caused both himself and others a tremendous amount of mitigable or completely avoidable suffering. His preconceived notions about Ostanians, the cause of the war, and the fates of those he wished to avenge, had all been shaken by those interactions. He was also forced to recognize that the beliefs he had accepted as the truth and clung to without question led him to spend most of his formative years wallowing in anger and bitter despair as a result. Additionally, he had come to realize that the Ostanians were just people who, like him, had been swept up by circumstances that they had felt strongly about, but had never stopped to truly think about. Upon joining WISE, Loid vowed to never make the mistake of allowing either unfounded beliefs or rampant emotionalism to rule him ever again.

                    As agent Twilight, Loid has worked as a spy for at least ten years after serving in the Westalian military for a few years. His skills are such that everyone at WISE recognizes him as the agency's best agent and overall, he can be considered a jack of all trades: Being extremely physically and mentally skilled, having a razor-sharp mind and intellect, and is able to adapt to nearly any situation, only ever surpassed combat-wise by stronger individuals like

He has a keen mind and has showcased exceptionally high-level intellectual feats on numerous occasions. He has a borderline photographic memory and once demonstrated the ability to recall the individual names of over 200 penguins simply by skimming over a list of their names and dietary habits, as well as remembering 
                        <a href="Yor Forger.html">Yor</a>

                    Loid is immensely observant to the point he can recognize the smallest of details, such as noticing his former apartment being raided before opening the door and a tennis court being subtly composed of 36 distinct panels. He was even able to deduce that Martha Marriott was an experienced former soldier by simply observing the way she presents herself and tell whether a person is telling the truth or not by watching their mannerisms. Loid is shown to have an unusually fast and complex thought process, capable of thinking and analyzing situations at incredible speeds (usually at 0.1 seconds). He can process immense amounts of information instantaneously, which makes it difficult for 
                    <a href="Anya Forger.html">Anya</a> 
                    to read his mind at certain points. On such occasions, it has made her mildly woozy, which would typically only occur if she was in the midst of a crowd and being exposed to many people's thoughts simultaneously.

                        Loid repeatedly displays ingenuity in combat, using flour as a smokescreen while fighting against a gang, quickly extrapolating the number of armed smugglers and the amount of time it takes to defeat them during a heated crossfire, and identifying a fake I.D. with no trouble. He can also intuitively read a person's body language and movements, as he was able to instantly recognize a purse thief in disguise by observing his walking pattern and is capable of elucidating conversations and discussions held from afar by reading the lips of a person. Loid is also capable of convincingly playing the part of a licensed medical doctor, with all of his co-workers and patients not only believing in his persona but considering him to be exceptionally capable. This is in spite of the fact that he has, presumably, not attended medical school.

                        in addition to his impeccable intelligence, Loid has demonstrated to be an exceptional strategist and tactician, being able to strategize and develop complex actions and plan ahead in advance. This is demonstrated during the second part of Eden's entrance exam, where he packed extra clothing in anticipation of them being dirtied or torn apart during the examination. He also wore a bulletproof vest in an underground tennis tournament and was instantly able to adapt to their various traps. Loid was even able to come up with several options to infiltrate the Imperial Scholar mixer's security in order to meet with Donovan Desmond and carefully revise the possibilities and consequences on each one. He is also an expert in lying and possesses incredibly fluent deception skills, being able to trick scientists into thinking he had stolen the Gerrulimus, luring them into locating and opening the locker containing the serum.

Notably, he possesses the skill to conceal these traps to such a degree that even the SSS, despite thoroughly surveying the terrain, remains unaware of their existence. His ability to hide traps with such precision adds an element of surprise and advantage to his tactical approach.

He would later use the same tactic when fighting in the second East-West war.

As a child, he has even admitted that he tends to get into roles he plays, to the point that one of his friends pointed out his intensity when they played war games. Later, as a spy, Twilight has utilized this ability in countless missions; as long as he has enough intel on the individual, like watching old home videos of them, he can pull off a believable impersonation. His skill is such that Ostanian Intelligence does not have the first clue as to what he actually looks like, despite their numerous agents knowing for certain that they have encountered him.

                        and Fiona so they can pose as SSS agents, in one case even creating a male disguise for Fiona. In a past mission, he was even able to pull off the part of a sumo wrestler in the Far East, in spite of the fact that he has nowhere near the girth required to be one.[24] With his disguises, Loid has always been able to evade capture from his enemies. In rare instances, he has been close to being cornered due to the enemy having more intel and thought ahead of him or outside factors, but was able to escape due to his quick thinking.

Loid is also capable of performing several evasive movements to avoid rubber bullets fired by snipers from multiple angles while playing tennis in an underground tournament, even being able to parry one of the bullets directly towards his opponent, and demonstrated the ability to jump higher than a normal human should be able to during this event. He also demonstrated an extraordinary level of acrobatics during the end of the game. Even upon being launched across the bar after receiving a full-blown kick from a flustered

                        <b>Master Polymath</b>
                        : Loid has demonstrated a borderline superhuman ability to master essentially any skill in an extremely short time span. This includes lockpicking, basic forgery, lip reading, bomb defusing, and military dog training. He can also do basic household chores such as sewing and, particularly, cooking. When partaking in a tennis competition with only a short period of practice, his performance was decisively superior to that of numerous professional players. During another mission, Loid also managed to convincingly play the part of a professional sumo wrestler, which would have been impossible without being able to imitate that particular skill set.

During his final shot against the Campbells in their tennis match, Carrol Campbell was so intimidated by Loid and his skills that he was frozen with fear as the ball was slammed under him. He is also able to inculcate fear into people with threats and the information he has on them. This was demonstrated when he held Edgar at gunpoint from behind and browbeaten him with the life of his daughter. He has once been able to intimidate

                        Loid also utilizes a variety of equipment and gadgets during his spy work, though several of them remain anonymous and have yet to be seen. Among the known ones is a miniature telescope, which he uses for long-distance surveillance while keeping himself out of view. While on missions, Loid normally carries a suitcase or traveling luggage bag that holds most of his spy equipment. Among those tools is a radio transmitter, which he uses to communicate with WISE headquarters and, as seen with

He even employs explosives, which he uses to blow up illegal arms dealers in one of his side missions. When necessary, Loid can wear stab-proof protective fabric underneath his clothing to avoid sustaining an injury from such, like a military-trained dog.

                        <b>Overassessment</b>
                        : Loid's primary weakness is his tendency to overanalyze certain situations. Loid is very serious in his duty to maintain peace. Due to his training and life as a spy, Loid is often seen planning and being extremely cautious, suspecting anyone who could be a potential threat to his mission or cover, which results in him overthinking things that, in reality, are much simpler than he thinks. For example, when Loid realized 
                        <a href="Yuri Briar.html">Yuri</a> 
                        was a member of the SSS, he suspected

                        could also be involved and was aware of his identity as a spy. Despite his intuition and previous background investigation clearing her, Loid chose to follow her and spy on her conversations with a listening device he secretly put on her dress, even going as far as disguising himself as an SSS lieutenant to press answers from her. After confirming that 
                        <a href="Yor Forger.html">Yor</a> 
                        is unaware of his and

                        secrets, Loid quickly feels guilty for doubting her.

                        : Likely due to his top-ranking status as Westalis's greatest spy, Loid is occasionally assigned to several kinds of missions with very little notice and time. Between multitasking on many different missions, on top of trying to maintain his long-term mission, Operation Strix, Loid has felt physically and mentally exhausted at certain points. Additionally, because of his strong sense of duty, Loid pushes himself to complete his tasks to the best of his ability. However, this sometimes causes him to lapse in judgment at times.
